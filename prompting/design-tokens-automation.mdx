Design tokens are the backbone of scalable design systems, but managing them across platforms and maintaining consistency can be time-consuming. AI can automate much of this process, from generating tokens to synchronizing them across tools and platforms.

## Token Generation Automation

### **Automated Color Palette Creation**

```text wrap
Create a comprehensive color palette for a [fintech app] with the following requirements:
- Primary brand color: #2563eb
- Generate 9 shades for each color (50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900)
- Include semantic tokens for success, warning, error, and info
- Ensure WCAG AA compliance for text contrast
- Output in JSON format with descriptive names
- Include both light and dark mode variants

Brand personality: [modern, trustworthy, professional]
Target audience: [business professionals, financial advisors]
```

### **Typography Scale Generation**

```text wrap
Generate a complete typography scale with the following specifications:
- Base font size: 16px
- Scale ratio: 1.25 (major third)
- Include 8 sizes from xs to 4xl
- Add line-height values optimized for readability
- Include font-weight variations (light, regular, medium, semibold, bold)
- Output as CSS custom properties and design tokens JSON
- Consider mobile responsive adjustments

Use case: [SaaS dashboard, content-heavy application]
Primary typeface: [Inter, system fonts]
```

### **Spacing System Creation**

```text wrap
Create a consistent spacing system based on these parameters:

- Include semantic spacing tokens (xs, sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl, 3xl)
- Add component-specific spacing (button-padding, card-padding, section-spacing)
- Output in multiple formats: px, rem, and design tokens JSON
- Include usage guidelines for each token

Design system context: [mobile-first, component library, multi-brand]
```

## Token Naming Automation

### **Semantic Token Naming**

```text wrap
Convert these primitive color tokens into semantic design tokens with consistent naming:

Primitive tokens:

- green-500: #10b981  
- red-500: #ef4444
- yellow-500: #f59e0b
- gray-100: #f3f4f6
- gray-900: #111827

Create semantic tokens following the pattern: [category]-[property]-[variant]-[state]
Categories: color, background, border, text
Variants: primary, secondary, accent, neutral
States: default, hover, active, disabled, focus

Include light and dark mode variations.
Provide usage context for each token.
```

### **Cross-Platform Token Naming**

```text wrap
Generate consistent design token names that work across these platforms:
- Web (CSS custom properties)

Source: Figma design tokens (colors, typography, spacing)
Targets: 
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript/TypeScript constants
- iOS Swift constants  
- Android XML resources

Requirements:
- Preserve token hierarchy and naming
- Handle token aliases and references
- Include validation rules
- Generate documentation automatically
- Set up automated testing for token consistency
- Handle version control and change detection

Output: Step-by-step automation script and configuration files
```

### **Multi-Brand Token Management**

```text wrap
Design an automated system for managing design tokens across multiple brands:

Brands: [Brand A (financial), Brand B (healthcare), Brand C (education)]
Shared tokens: Typography scale, spacing system, component structure
Brand-specific tokens: Colors, brand fonts, iconography

Create:
- Token inheritance structure
- Automated token generation from brand guidelines
- Cross-brand consistency checks
- Platform-specific token distribution
- Documentation generation for each brand
- Version management strategy

Include: JSON schema, validation rules, and sync workflows
```

## Token Validation & Quality Assurance

### **Automated Token Auditing**

```text wrap
Create comprehensive validation rules for design token quality:

Check for:
- Color contrast compliance (WCAG AA/AAA)
- Typography scale consistency
- Spacing system adherence
- Naming convention compliance
- Token reference integrity
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Performance impact assessment

Generate:
- Automated audit report
- Violation prioritization (critical, warning, info)
- Remediation suggestions
- Before/after comparison tools
- Integration with CI/CD pipeline
- Dashboard for monitoring token health
