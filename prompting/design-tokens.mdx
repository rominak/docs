#### Generate a Design Token System

```text wrap
Generate a complete design token system for [brand/product] using [token format: CSS custom properties/JSON/YAML]. Include color, typography, spacing, and component tokens with semantic naming.
```

#### Naming design tokens

```text wrap
Create design tokens following the [naming convention: BEM/atomic/tier-based] pattern. Structure them for [use case: design system/component library/multi-brand] with proper hierarchy and inheritance.
```

```markdown
Create design tokens using the tier-based naming convention and follow the structure:
component-category-state-role

Component: The UI element (e.g. button, input, card)

Category: The design property (e.g. color, spacing, borderRadius, typography)

State: The UI state (e.g. default, hover, active, disabled)

Role: The semantic intent (e.g. primary, secondary, success, error)

Structure the tokens for a [design system / component library / multi-brand setup].
Ensure:

Clear hierarchy from foundations to component-level tokens

Logical inheritance (semantic tokens referencing foundational values)

Scalability for adding new components, states, or roles

Example tokens for at least 2 components (e.g. button and input)

Output should be in JSON or Tokens Studio-compatible format.
```

#### Typography Tokens

```text wrap
Create typography tokens following this pattern: [font-family/size/weight/line-height]-[scale/variant]. 
Include responsive scaling and semantic hierarchy (heading, body, caption, etc.).
```

#### Accessibility Tokens

```text wrap
Create accessibility tokens for: focus indicators, high contrast modes, reduced motion, and screen reader states. Include WCAG compliance markers.
```

#### Audit Design Tokens

```text wrap
Audit these design tokens for: naming consistency, proper hierarchy, accessibility compliance, and missing variants. Suggest improvements.
```

```
Compare the color tokens used in this Figma frame to the tokens in tokens-studio.json. List mismatches and auto-fix the ones that are off by ≤2 %.
```

```
Run accessibility checks on the selected frame, annotate WCAG 2.2 violations directly on the layers, and export an .xliff file for localization.
```

#### Create a Token Implementation Status Table

```text wrap
Create a token implementation status table with: Token Name | Design Status | Development Status | Testing Status | Documentation Status | Release Version | Known Issues.
```

#### Generate a JSON Array of Token Objects

```text wrap
Generate a JSON array of token objects that can be imported into spreadsheet tools: [ { "tokenName": "color-primary-500", "value": "#3B82F6", "category": "Color", "usage": "Primary buttons" } ]
```

#### Figma Variables 

```text wrap
Compare Figma variables with design tokens in code and identify: missing variables, unused tokens, and synchronization issues.
```

```
Extract all variables from the Figma file and upsert them into Airtable base Design Tokens v2. If a variable already exists, update its value; if not, create it. Map Figma scopes to Airtable Group field.
```

**Figma MCP**

```
Figma MCP: “Use get_variable_defs, then output a Tailwind config that maps them 1-to-1
```
