# Component Development Workflow with Figma MCP

This workflow should be followed whenever a Figma link is provided for component development.

## Workflow Steps

### 1. Initial Setup & Analysis
- **Initialize Figma MCP Connection**
  - Use the Figma MCP (Model Context Protocol) for design system integration
  - Verify access to the design file/project
  - Extract node ID from provided Figma URL

### 2. Analyze Figma Design
- **Extract Component Data**

### 3. Generate Component Specifications

#### Visual Specifications:
- Dimensions (width, height, padding, margins)
- Typography (font family, size, weight, line-height)
- Colors (fill, stroke, gradients)
- Border radius and shadows
- Spacing and alignment rules

#### Behavioral Specifications:
- Interactive states (hover, active, focus, disabled)
- Animations and transitions
- Responsive behavior and breakpoints
- Accessibility requirements (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)

### 4. Implementation Phase

#### Create Interactive Component:
- Build fully functional component matching Figma design
- Implement all interactive states and behaviors
- Add proper TypeScript types/interfaces
- Include all variants from Figma
- Ensure responsive design implementation
- Add proper error handling and edge cases

### 5. Create Preview Showcases

#### Design Tokens Preview:
- Color tokens used in the component
- Typography scale and tokens
- Spacing tokens (margins, padding, gaps)
- Border radius tokens
- Shadow/elevation tokens
- Animation/transition tokens


#### Styles Preview:
- All component variants side by side
- Theme variations (light/dark mode if applicable)
- Size variations (small, medium, large)
- State demonstrations (interactive demo)
- Responsive behavior at different breakpoints

#### Properties Preview:
- Live prop manipulation interface
- Documentation for each prop
- Code examples for common use cases
- Validation rules and constraints
- Default values clearly indicated

### 6. Component-Specific Features


### 7. Documentation Generation
(describe what you want)

### 8. Testing Setup
(describe what you want)

## Output Structure

### Directory Organization:
(describe what you want)

## Execution Order

1. **Parse Figma URL** → Extract node ID
2. **Fetch Design Data** → Get all component information from Figma
3. **Analyze & Document** → Create specifications
4. **Build Component** → Implement with all features
5. **Create Previews** → Generate visual showcases
6. **Write Documentation** → Complete usage guides
7. **Setup Tests** → Ensure quality

```

```
Build a reusable React input component that matches these Figma specs (paste link).  
  
Use CDN React + plain CSS, include states (default, focus, disabled, read-only, error, success), optional left/right icons, hint/error/success messaging, and a demo page that showcases each state and size.

# Bare Minimum Prompt

**Figma Link**: [Share your Figma design link here]

## Task
Short description what you want

### Core Behavior
Short description what you want

### Tech
- Vanilla JS, Tailwind CSS, Inter font
- 16px icons, keyboard accessible
- Emit `filterChange` event

### Files
- `index.html`, `filter.js`, `styles.css`

**Done when**: Matches Figma design with full interactivity.
```

**Prompt from the video Vibe-coding for designers #2 - Model vs Prompt**

```
**Step 1**: Paste your Figma design link here: https://www.figma.com/design/JWFZuCni2InkUy3l9hXGhw/Vibe-coding-for-designers?node-id=24-221&t=IGawd6TwL5a88eLG-1

## Task
Create an interactive filter chip component that matches the Figma design with these behaviors:

### Core Functionality
- **Two states**: "All" state (unfiltered) and "Selected" state (filtered)
- **State switching**: Component changes appearance/content between states
- **Interactive dropdown**: Click chip to open selection interface
- **Dynamic content**: Shows different text/icons based on current state
- **Remove action**: Way to delete/clear the filter entirely

### Required Interactions
1. **Default state**: Component shows initial appearance from Figma
2. **Click chip**: Opens dropdown/modal for user selections
3. **Make selections**: User can choose/unchoose options
4. **Apply changes**: Component updates to show selections
5. **Clear/remove**: User can reset or delete the filter

### Technical Requirements
- **Framework**: Use what fits your project (React, Vue, vanilla JS, etc.)
- **Styling**: Match Figma specs exactly (colors, fonts, spacing, borders)
- **Icons**: Implement icon switching between states as shown in design
- **Responsive**: Ensure mobile-friendly touch targets
- **Accessible**: Keyboard navigation + screen reader support
- **Events**: Emit changes so parent components can respond

### Implementation Guide
1. **Analyze Figma**: Identify the two states and their visual differences
2. **Extract tokens**: Colors, typography, spacing, border radius from design
3. **Plan interactions**: Map user actions to state changes
4. **Build component**: Start with static states, add interactivity
5. **Test thoroughly**: Verify all interactions work across devices

### Success Criteria
✅ Visual design matches Figma exactly  
✅ State transitions work smoothly  
✅ Dropdown/selection interface functions correctly  
✅ Component integrates with parent application  
✅ Accessible via keyboard and screen readers  
✅ Works on mobile and desktop  

**Deliverable**: Functional filter component that replicates Figma design with full interactivity.
