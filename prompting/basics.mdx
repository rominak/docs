### General Prompting Suggestions 

**Be clear about what you want:** AI tools like Cursor and Claude Code work best when you tell them exactly what you're trying to build. The clearer you are, the better results you'll get.

**Start with the design problem:** Before asking for code, explain what user experience you're creating. Are you building a mobile menu? A product card? A signup flow? When the AI understands your design goals, it can write much better code.

**Give context, but leave room for creativity:** Share your brand colors, spacing rules, or design system basics, but don't micromanage every detail. AI tools are surprisingly good at filling in the gaps and might suggest solutions you hadn't thought of.

**Use AI for more than just coding:** These tools can help you brainstorm component names, suggest better CSS organization, check if your design is accessible, or even help you write documentation for your design system.

**Try different tools for different tasks:** Cursor might be great for understanding your existing codebase, while Claude Code could be better for starting fresh projects. Don't stick to just oneâ€”experiment to see what works best for your workflow.

**Automate the boring stuff:** Notice what design tasks you do over and overâ€”like converting Figma designs to CSS, creating responsive breakpoints, or updating design tokens. These are perfect candidates for AI automation.

**Build a library of useful prompts:** When you find prompts that work well (like "create a card component with hover effects" or "make this design mobile-friendly"), save them. You'll use them again, and they'll save you time.

**Start simple:** Don't try to revolutionize your entire workflow on day one. Pick one small, annoying taskâ€”maybe generating CSS for a buttonâ€”and see if AI can help. Build from there.

**Make it work for you:** Some designers like detailed comments in their code, others prefer it clean and minimal. Some want step-by-step explanations, others just want the final result. Train the AI to match your style and preferences.
