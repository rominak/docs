Building on the basics of Cursor setup, this guide explores advanced techniques for integrating Claude with Cursor to create powerful design-to-code workflows, multi-model strategies, and sophisticated AI development patterns.

## Multi-Model Strategy Setup

### **Primary and Secondary Model Configuration**

```text wrap
Configure Cursor to use multiple AI models strategically:

Primary model (Claude 3.5 Sonnet): Complex design system implementation, architecture decisions, code reviews
Secondary model (GPT-4): Quick iterations, debugging, documentation generation  
Specialized model (Codestral): Performance optimization, refactoring, code analysis

Set up model switching shortcuts:
- Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + 1: Claude for design system work
- Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + 2: GPT-4 for rapid prototyping
- Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + 3: Codestral for optimization

Create context templates for each model with specific instructions and examples.
```

### **Model-Specific Prompt Engineering**

**For Claude (Design System Focus):**
```text wrap
You are working on a design system implementation. Consider:
- Component reusability and composition patterns
- Accessibility requirements (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- TypeScript best practices for props and interfaces
- Design token integration and theming
- Storybook documentation standards
- Performance implications of component architecture

Current design system context: [Component library using Radix UI, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript]
Brand requirements: [Consistent spacing scale, accessible color palette, responsive design]

Task: [Your specific request]
```

**For Quick Iterations (GPT-4):**
```text wrap
Focus on rapid development and quick solutions:
- Prioritize working code over perfect architecture
- Use common patterns and established libraries
- Provide minimal, functional implementations
- Include basic error handling
- Generate placeholder content where needed

Development context: [React, Next.js, quick prototype]
Time constraint: [Need working solution in under 30 minutes]

Task: [Your specific request]
```

## Advanced Design-to-Code Workflows

### **Figma Design Analysis**

```text wrap
Analyze this Figma design and create implementation plan:

Design file: [Paste Figma URL or screenshot]

Analysis needed:
1. Component hierarchy and atomic design structure
2. Responsive behavior patterns across breakpoints
3. Design token extraction (colors, typography, spacing, shadows)
4. Interaction states and micro-animations
5. Accessibility considerations and ARIA requirements
6. Performance optimization opportunities

Generate:
- Component architecture diagram
- Props interface definitions
- Styled-components/CSS structure
- Implementation priority ranking
- Testing strategy for each component
- Storybook story templates

Tech stack: [React, TypeScript, Styled-components, Framer Motion]
```

### **Design System Component Generation**

```text wrap
Create a complete design system component from design specifications:

Component: [Button, Card, Modal, etc.]
Design specs:
- Variants: [primary, secondary, tertiary, destructive]
- Sizes: [sm, md, lg, xl]
- States: [default, hover, active, disabled, loading]
- Responsive behavior: [Mobile-first approach]

Requirements:
- TypeScript interfaces with comprehensive prop types
- Compound component pattern where appropriate
- Forward refs for DOM manipulation
- Accessibility features built-in (ARIA, keyboard navigation)
- CSS-in-JS or utility class implementation
- Animation and transition handling
- Error boundaries and fallback states
- Comprehensive Storybook stories
- Unit and integration tests
- JSDoc documentation

Include usage examples and integration guidelines.
```

### **Design Token Integration**

```text wrap
Integrate design tokens into component implementation:

Token structure:
```json
{
  "color": {
    "brand": {
      "primary": { "value": "#2563eb" },
      "secondary": { "value": "#64748b" }
    },
    "semantic": {
      "success": { "value": "{color.green.500}" },
      "error": { "value": "{color.red.500}" }
    }
  },
  "spacing": {
    "xs": { "value": "0.25rem" },
    "sm": { "value": "0.5rem" },
    "md": { "value": "1rem" }
  }
}
```

Create:
- Token-aware component implementations
- Type-safe token consumption patterns
- Theme switching capabilities
- Runtime token validation
- Development-time token assistance
- Token usage analytics integration

Output: Components that dynamically consume design tokens with full TypeScript support.
```
