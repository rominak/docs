Here is an example of a prompt for generating a color palette for a design project. You can copy the text below and adapt it for your own needs.

```text "Color Palette Generation"
Generate a color palette for a modern, minimalist website for a luxury brand. The brand's values are sophistication, elegance, and simplicity. Provide hex codes for a primary color, a secondary color, an accent color, and a neutral background color. The palette should be visually balanced and accessible.
