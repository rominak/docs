Create a user flow for a [fitness app] that helps users set goals, track workouts, and view progress over time.
```

```text "User Analysis"
Analyze [target audience/user group] and their pain points when [specific task]. What are their motivations, frustrations, and current workarounds? Include behavioral patterns and emotional triggers.
```

```text "Design Trend Research"
Research current design trends in [industry/category] and identify what's working well and what's becoming outdated. Provide specific examples and explain why these trends are effective.
```

```text "Competitive Analysis"
Conduct a competitive analysis of [competitor names] focusing on their UX/UI approach to [specific feature]. What are their strengths and weaknesses?
```

```text "Problem Solving"
I need to solve [specific problem] for [user type]. Brainstorm unconventional approaches that challenge typical design assumptions. Think beyond standard solutions.
```

### Design Tokens Prompts

```text "Generate Design Token System"
Generate a complete design token system for [brand/product] using [token format: CSS custom properties/JSON/YAML]. Include color, typography, spacing, and component tokens with semantic naming.
```

```text "Create Design Tokens with Naming Convention"
Create design tokens following the [naming convention: BEM/atomic/tier-based] pattern. Structure them for [use case: design system/component library/multi-brand] with proper hierarchy and inheritance.
```

```text "Create Typography Tokens"
Create typography tokens following this pattern: [font-family/size/weight/line-height]-[scale/variant]. Include responsive scaling and semantic hierarchy (heading, body, caption, etc.).
```

```text "Build Accessibility Tokens"
Build accessibility tokens for: focus indicators, high contrast modes, reduced motion, and screen reader states. Include WCAG compliance markers.
```

```text "Audit Design Tokens"
Audit these design tokens for: naming consistency, proper hierarchy, accessibility compliance, and missing variants. Suggest improvements.
```

```text "Create Token Implementation Status Table"
Create a token implementation status table with: Token Name | Design Status | Development Status | Testing Status | Documentation Status | Release Version | Known Issues.
```

```text "Generate JSON Array of Token Objects"
Generate a JSON array of token objects that can be imported into spreadsheet tools: [ { "tokenName": "color-primary-500", "value": "#3B82F6", "category": "Color", "usage": "Primary buttons" } ]
```

```text "Compare Figma Variables with Design Tokens"
Compare Figma variables with design tokens in code and identify: missing variables, unused tokens, and synchronization issues.
```

### Clickable Prototypes Prompts

```text "Design Mobile-First Interface"
Design a mobile-first interface for [specific function] that prioritizes [key user action]. Consider thumb-friendly navigation and progressive disclosure.
```

```text "Extract Design Tokens from Figma"
Extract all design tokens from the current Figma file and generate a complete token system. Create CSS custom properties, TypeScript definitions, and Tailwind config. Sync any changes back to Figma as styles.
```

```text "Create Framework Component"
Create a [framework] component for [specific functionality] following [design system/style guide]. Include proper TypeScript types, error handling, and accessibility attributes.
```

```text "Create Healthcare Prototype"
Create a healthcare prototype for [specific workflow] with: patient data management, appointment scheduling, telemedicine interface, and HIPAA compliance considerations.
```

```text "Create README.md"
Create a README.md for this project that includes setup instructions, API documentation, and contribution guidelines. Project details: [project description]
```

```text "Create Prototype with Comprehensive Documentation"
Create a prototype with comprehensive documentation: component specifications, interaction details, API requirements, and implementation notes for development handoff.
```

```text "Create Prototype with A/B Testing"
Create a prototype with built-in A/B testing: variant switching, metrics collection, statistical significance tracking, and results visualization.
```

### Cursor Specific Instructions

```text "Query Figma Variables"
Query Figma variables and create a TypeScript token definition file. Include: variable types, mode mappings, and compile-time validation for all variable references.
```

```text "Use @web for Current Standards"
Use @web for current standards: Reference modern CSS features like custom properties, calc(), and container queries.
```

```text "Include File Generation"
Include file generation: Create actual token files (CSS, JSON, TypeScript) that I can directly implement.
```

```text "Request Multiple Formats"
Request multiple formats: Generate design tokens in different formats for your entire design-to-development pipeline.
```

```text "Ask for Tooling Integration"
Ask for tooling integration: Include build scripts, Figma plugins, or validation tools in your token system.
```

```text "Specify Inheritance Patterns"
Specify inheritance patterns: Be explicit about how tokens should reference each other and maintain consistency.
