The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open-source standard that is rapidly changing how AI tools and design applications like Figma work together. Think of it as a universal connector that allows AI assistants to understand and interact with your designs on a much deeper level.

This guide will explain what MCP is, why it matters for designers, and how you can use it to streamline your workflow.

### What is MCP?

MCP is a protocol that enables AI-powered systems to connect to software applications in a standardized way. Before MCP, connecting an AI tool to an app required a custom, one-off integration. Now, an app like Figma can build a single MCP server, and any AI tool with an MCP client (like Cursor) can connect to it.

This two-way communication allows the AI to not only "see" your designs but also to access the underlying data—like design tokens, component properties, and styles. This rich context is invaluable for generating high-quality, production-ready code from your Figma files.

As Figma's article on MCP explains, "The more context an AI assistant has, the better it’s able to understand the specific nuances of a request and deliver a high-quality output." [Source](https://www.figma.com/resource-library/what-is-mcp/)

### Why MCP Matters for Designers

For designers, MCP bridges the gap between design and development more effectively than ever before. Here are some of the key benefits:

*   **Higher-Fidelity Code:** By understanding the full context of your designs, AI tools can generate code that accurately reflects your design system's variables, components, and styles.
*   **Faster Handoffs:** Developers can work more efficiently when the AI can directly interpret design files, reducing the need for manual specification and redlining.
*   **Improved Collaboration:** When AI can speak the language of both design and code, it becomes a much more powerful collaborator in the product development process.
