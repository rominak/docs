<Step title="Set Up Your Workspace">
  A workspace is like a project folder. It keeps all your documentation files organized in one place. Let's open your project folder.

  1.  Launch Cursor if it's not already open.
  2.  From the top menu, select **File > Open Folder...** (or simply **File > Open...** on macOS).
  3.  Navigate to the folder containing your documentation files and click **Open**.

  <Note>
  You'll now see your project's files and folders listed in the **Explorer** panel on the left-hand side.
  </Note>
</Step>

<Step title="Find Your Way Around the Editor">
  Cursor's interface is designed to be simple and intuitive. Here are the key areas you'll work with:

  -   **Explorer (Left Sidebar):** Your file browser. Click any file to open it for editing.
  -   **Editor (Center Area):** This is where you'll write and edit your content.
  -   **AI Chat (Right Sidebar):** Interact with the AI to generate or modify content.
</Step>

<Step title="Edit a File">
  Editing your documentation is straightforward.

  1.  From the **Explorer**, click on the file you want to change (e.g., `guides/prompts.mdx`).
  2.  The file will open in the **Editor**.
  3.  Click into the editor and begin typing. Your changes are saved automatically.
  
  <Tip>
  You can have multiple files open at once. They will appear as tabs at the top of the editor.
  </Tip>
</Step>

<Step title="Use AI to Make Changes">
  The core of Cursor is its AI assistant. You can give it instructions in plain English to speed up your workflow.

  1.  Open the file you want to edit.
  2.  Press `Cmd + K` (macOS) or `Ctrl + K` (Windows/Linux) to activate the AI prompt.
  3.  Type a command, such as "Add a new section about color theory."
  4.  Press **Enter** and watch the AI generate the content for you.
</Step>
</Steps>

You're all set! You have successfully installed Cursor, set up your project, and learned the basics of editing with AI. Happy documenting!
