### 2. Setting Up Your Workspace

Think of a workspace in Cursor like a project file in your favorite design tool. It holds all the files and folders for a specific project, keeping everything organized and easy to access.

#### Opening a Project Folder

To get started, you'll want to open the main folder that contains all your documentation files.

1.  Launch Cursor.
2.  Go to the "File" menu in the top-left corner.
3.  Select **"Open Folder..."**. (On macOS, this might just say "Open...")
4.  Navigate to your project folder (the one with all your `.mdx` files) and click "Open".

Your project is now open! You'll see all your files and folders listed in the left-hand sidebar, which is called the **Explorer**.

### 3. Finding Your Way Around

Cursor's interface is simple. Here are the main parts you'll use:

-   **Explorer (Left Sidebar):** This is your file browser. Click on any file here to open it.
-   **Editor (Center Area):** This is where your files open up. You can write and edit your content here.
-   **AI Chat (Right Sidebar):** This is where you can "talk" to Cursor to ask it to write or change code and content for you.

### 4. Opening and Editing a File

Editing your documentation is as simple as editing a text document.

1.  In the **Explorer** on the left, find the file you want to edit (for example, `guides/prompts.mdx`).
2.  Click on the filename. It will open in the **Editor** area.
3.  Click anywhere in the editor and start typing to make your changes.
4.  Your changes are saved automatically!

### 5. Using AI to Make Changes

The real power of Cursor is its AI. You can ask it to make changes for you using plain English.

1.  Open a file you want to change.
2.  Press `Cmd + K` (on macOS) or `Ctrl + K` (on Windows/Linux) to open the AI prompt bar.
3.  Type what you want to do. For example: "Add a new section about color theory."
4.  Press Enter, and watch the AI generate the content for you.

You're all set! You've learned how to install Cursor, set up a project, and make basic edits. Happy documenting!
