### General Prompting Suggestions 

**Be clear about what you want:** AI tools like Cursor and Claude Code work best when you tell them exactly what you're trying to build. The clearer you are, the better results you'll get.

**Start with the design problem:** Before asking for code, explain what user experience you're creating. Are you building a mobile menu? A product card? A signup flow? When the AI understands your design goals, it can write much better code.

**Give context, but leave room for creativity:** Share your brand colors, spacing rules, or design system basics, but don't micromanage every detail. AI tools are surprisingly good at filling in the gaps and might suggest solutions you hadn't thought of.

**Use AI for more than just coding:** These tools can help you brainstorm component names, suggest better CSS organization, check if your design is accessible, or even help you write documentation for your design system.

**Try different tools for different tasks:** Cursor might be great for understanding your existing codebase, while Claude Code could be better for starting fresh projects. Don't stick to just oneâ€”experiment to see what works best for your workflow.

**Automate the boring stuff:** Notice what design tasks you do over and overâ€”like converting Figma designs to CSS, creating responsive breakpoints, or updating design tokens. These are perfect candidates for AI automation.

**Build a library of useful prompts:** When you find prompts that work well (like "create a card component with hover effects" or "make this design mobile-friendly"), save them. You'll use them again, and they'll save you time.

**Start simple:** Don't try to revolutionize your entire workflow on day one. Pick one small, annoying taskâ€”maybe generating CSS for a buttonâ€”and see if AI can help. Build from there.

**Make it work for you:** Some designers like detailed comments in their code, others prefer it clean and minimal. Some want step-by-step explanations, others just want the final result. Train the AI to match your style and preferences.

Let's dive into prompts ðŸ‘‡

### Research Prompts

This section covers prompts for understanding users and the competitive landscape.

- **User Flow Creation**
- **User Analysis**
- **Design Trend Research**
- **Competitive Analysis**
- **Creative Problem-Solving**

#### User Flow Creation

```text wrap
Create a user flow for a [fitness app] that helps users set goals, track workouts, and view progress over time.
```

#### User Analysis

```text wrap
Analyze [target audience/user group] and their pain points when [specific task]. What are their motivations, frustrations, and current workarounds? Include behavioral patterns and emotional triggers.
```

#### Design Trend Research

```text wrap
Research current design trends in [industry/category] and identify what's working well and what's becoming outdated. Provide specific examples and explain why these trends are effective.
```

#### Competitive Analysis

```text wrap
Conduct a competitive analysis of [competitor names] focusing on their UX/UI approach to [specific feature]. What are their strengths and weaknesses?
```

#### Creative Problem-Solving

```text wrap
I need to solve [specific problem] for [user type]. Brainstorm unconventional approaches that challenge typical design assumptions. Think beyond standard solutions.
```

### Design Tokens Prompts

This section provides prompts for creating and managing a robust design token system.

- **Generate a Design Token System**
- **Create Tokens with a Naming Convention**
- **Create Typography Tokens**
- **Build Accessibility Tokens**
- **Audit Design Tokens**
- **Create a Token Implementation Status Table**
- **Generate a JSON Array of Token Objects**
- **Compare Figma Variables with Design Tokens**

#### Generate a Design Token System

```text wrap
Generate a complete design token system for [brand/product] using [token format: CSS custom properties/JSON/YAML]. Include color, typography, spacing, and component tokens with semantic naming.
```

#### Create Tokens with a Naming Convention

```text wrap
Create design tokens following the [naming convention: BEM/atomic/tier-based] pattern. Structure them for [use case: design system/component library/multi-brand] with proper hierarchy and inheritance.
```

#### Create Typography Tokens

```text wrap
Create typography tokens following this pattern: [font-family/size/weight/line-height]-[scale/variant]. Include responsive scaling and semantic hierarchy (heading, body, caption, etc.).
```

#### Build Accessibility Tokens

```text wrap
Build accessibility tokens for: focus indicators, high contrast modes, reduced motion, and screen reader states. Include WCAG compliance markers.
```

#### Audit Design Tokens

```text wrap
Audit these design tokens for: naming consistency, proper hierarchy, accessibility compliance, and missing variants. Suggest improvements.
```

#### Create a Token Implementation Status Table

```text wrap
Create a token implementation status table with: Token Name | Design Status | Development Status | Testing Status | Documentation Status | Release Version | Known Issues.
```

#### Generate a JSON Array of Token Objects

```text wrap
Generate a JSON array of token objects that can be imported into spreadsheet tools: [ { "tokenName": "color-primary-500", "value": "#3B82F6", "category": "Color", "usage": "Primary buttons" } ]
```

#### Compare Figma Variables with Design Tokens

```text wrap
Compare Figma variables with design tokens in code and identify: missing variables, unused tokens, and synchronization issues.
```

### Clickable Prototypes Prompts
