### Research Prompts

This section covers prompts for understanding users and the competitive landscape.

- **User Flow Creation**
- **User Analysis**
- **Design Trend Research**
- **Competitive Analysis**
- **Creative Problem-Solving**

#### User Flow Creation

```text wrap
Create a user flow for a [fitness app] that helps users set goals, track workouts, and view progress over time.
```

#### User Analysis

```text wrap
Analyze [target audience/user group] and their pain points when [specific task]. What are their motivations, frustrations, and current workarounds? Include behavioral patterns and emotional triggers.
```

#### Design Trend Research

```text wrap
Research current design trends in [industry/category] and identify what's working well and what's becoming outdated. Provide specific examples and explain why these trends are effective.
```

#### Competitive Analysis

```text wrap
Conduct a competitive analysis of [competitor names] focusing on their UX/UI approach to [specific feature]. What are their strengths and weaknesses?
```

#### Creative Problem-Solving

```text wrap
I need to solve [specific problem] for [user type]. Brainstorm unconventional approaches that challenge typical design assumptions. Think beyond standard solutions.
```

### Design Tokens Prompts

This section provides prompts for creating and managing a robust design token system.

- **Generate a Design Token System**
- **Create Tokens with a Naming Convention**
- **Create Typography Tokens**
- **Build Accessibility Tokens**
- **Audit Design Tokens**
- **Create a Token Implementation Status Table**
- **Generate a JSON Array of Token Objects**
- **Compare Figma Variables with Design Tokens**

#### Generate a Design Token System

```text wrap
Generate a complete design token system for [brand/product] using [token format: CSS custom properties/JSON/YAML]. Include color, typography, spacing, and component tokens with semantic naming.
```

#### Create Tokens with a Naming Convention

```text wrap
Create design tokens following the [naming convention: BEM/atomic/tier-based] pattern. Structure them for [use case: design system/component library/multi-brand] with proper hierarchy and inheritance.
```

#### Create Typography Tokens

```text wrap
Create typography tokens following this pattern: [font-family/size/weight/line-height]-[scale/variant]. Include responsive scaling and semantic hierarchy (heading, body, caption, etc.).
```

#### Build Accessibility Tokens

```text wrap
Build accessibility tokens for: focus indicators, high contrast modes, reduced motion, and screen reader states. Include WCAG compliance markers.
```

#### Audit Design Tokens

```text wrap
Audit these design tokens for: naming consistency, proper hierarchy, accessibility compliance, and missing variants. Suggest improvements.
```

#### Create a Token Implementation Status Table

```text wrap
Create a token implementation status table with: Token Name | Design Status | Development Status | Testing Status | Documentation Status | Release Version | Known Issues.
```

#### Generate a JSON Array of Token Objects

```text wrap
Generate a JSON array of token objects that can be imported into spreadsheet tools: [ { "tokenName": "color-primary-500", "value": "#3B82F6", "category": "Color", "usage": "Primary buttons" } ]
```

#### Compare Figma Variables with Design Tokens

```text wrap
Compare Figma variables with design tokens in code and identify: missing variables, unused tokens, and synchronization issues.
```

### Clickable Prototypes Prompts

This section includes prompts for designing and building interactive prototypes.

- **Design a Mobile-First Interface**
- **Extract Design Tokens from Figma**
- **Create a Framework Component**
- **Create a Healthcare Prototype**
- **Create a README.md**
- **Create a Prototype with Comprehensive Documentation**
- **Create a Prototype with A/B Testing**

#### Design a Mobile-First Interface

```text wrap
Design a mobile-first interface for [specific function] that prioritizes [key user action]. Consider thumb-friendly navigation and progressive disclosure.
```

#### Extract Design Tokens from Figma

```text wrap
Extract all design tokens from the current Figma file and generate a complete token system. Create CSS custom properties, TypeScript definitions, and Tailwind config. Sync any changes back to Figma as styles.
```

#### Create a Framework Component

```text wrap
Create a [framework] component for [specific functionality] following [design system/style guide]. Include proper TypeScript types, error handling, and accessibility attributes.
```

#### Create a Healthcare Prototype

```text wrap
Create a healthcare prototype for [specific workflow] with: patient data management, appointment scheduling, telemedicine interface, and HIPAA compliance considerations.
```

#### Create a README.md

```text wrap
Create a README.md for this project that includes setup instructions, API documentation, and contribution guidelines. Project details: [project description]
```

#### Create a Prototype with Comprehensive Documentation

```text wrap
Create a prototype with comprehensive documentation: component specifications, interaction details, API requirements, and implementation notes for development handoff.
```

#### Create a Prototype with A/B Testing

```text wrap
Create a prototype with built-in A/B testing: variant switching, metrics collection, statistical significance tracking, and results visualization.
```

### Cursor Specific Instructions

How to work with Cursor in the most effective way?

- **Query Figma Variables**
- **Use @web for Current Standards**
- **Include File Generation**
- **Request Multiple Formats**
- **Ask for Tooling Integration**
- **Specify Inheritance Patterns**

#### Query Figma Variables

```text wrap
Query all Figma variables and generate a TypeScript definition file.
```
