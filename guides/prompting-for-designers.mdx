### Research Prompts

This section covers prompts for understanding users and the competitive landscape.

+ **User Flow Creation**
+ **User Analysis**
+ **Design Trend Research**
+ **Competitive Analysis**
+ **Creative Problem-Solving**

#### User Flow Creation
```text "User Flow Creation" wrap
Create a user flow for a [fitness app] that helps users set goals, track workouts, and view progress over time.
```

#### User Analysis
```text "User Analysis" wrap
Analyze [target audience/user group] and their pain points when [specific task]. What are their motivations, frustrations, and current workarounds? Include behavioral patterns and emotional triggers.
```

#### Design Trend Research
```text "Design Trend Research" wrap
Research current design trends in [industry/category] and identify what's working well and what's becoming outdated. Provide specific examples and explain why these trends are effective.
```

#### Competitive Analysis
```text "Competitive Analysis" wrap
Conduct a competitive analysis of [competitor names] focusing on their UX/UI approach to [specific feature]. What are their strengths and weaknesses?
```

#### Creative Problem-Solving
```text "Problem Solving" wrap
I need to solve [specific problem] for [user type]. Brainstorm unconventional approaches that challenge typical design assumptions. Think beyond standard solutions.
```

### Design Tokens Prompts

This section provides prompts for creating and managing a robust design token system.

+ **Generate a Design Token System**
+ **Create Tokens with a Naming Convention**
+ **Create Typography Tokens**
+ **Build Accessibility Tokens**
+ **Audit Design Tokens**
+ **Create a Token Implementation Status Table**
+ **Generate a JSON Array of Token Objects**
+ **Compare Figma Variables with Design Tokens**

#### Generate a Design Token System
```text "Generate Design Token System" wrap
Generate a complete design token system for [brand/product] using [token format: CSS custom properties/JSON/YAML]. Include color, typography, spacing, and component tokens with semantic naming.
```

#### Create Tokens with a Naming Convention
```text "Create Design Tokens with Naming Convention" wrap
Create design tokens following the [naming convention: BEM/atomic/tier-based] pattern. Structure them for [use case: design system/component library/multi-brand] with proper hierarchy and inheritance.
```

#### Create Typography Tokens
```text "Create Typography Tokens" wrap
Create typography tokens following this pattern: [font-family/size/weight/line-height]-[scale/variant]. Include responsive scaling and semantic hierarchy (heading, body, caption, etc.).
```

#### Build Accessibility Tokens
```text "Build Accessibility Tokens" wrap
Build accessibility tokens for: focus indicators, high contrast modes, reduced motion, and screen reader states. Include WCAG compliance markers.
```

#### Audit Design Tokens
```text "Audit Design Tokens" wrap
Audit these design tokens for: naming consistency, proper hierarchy, accessibility compliance, and missing variants. Suggest improvements.
```

#### Create a Token Implementation Status Table
```text "Create Token Implementation Status Table" wrap
Create a token implementation status table with: Token Name | Design Status | Development Status | Testing Status | Documentation Status | Release Version | Known Issues.
```

#### Generate a JSON Array of Token Objects
```text "Generate JSON Array of Token Objects" wrap
Generate a JSON array of token objects that can be imported into spreadsheet tools: [ { "tokenName": "color-primary-500", "value": "#3B82F6", "category": "Color", "usage": "Primary buttons" } ]
```

#### Compare Figma Variables with Design Tokens
```text "Compare Figma Variables with Design Tokens" wrap
Compare Figma variables with design tokens in code and identify: missing variables, unused tokens, and synchronization issues.
```

### Clickable Prototypes Prompts

This section includes prompts for designing and building interactive prototypes.

+ **Design a Mobile-First Interface**
+ **Extract Design Tokens from Figma**

```

#### Extract Design Tokens from Figma
```text "Extract Design Tokens from Figma" wrap
Extract all design tokens from the current Figma file and generate a complete token system. Create CSS custom properties, TypeScript definitions, and Tailwind config. Sync any changes back to Figma as styles.
```

#### Create a Framework Component
```text "Create Framework Component" wrap
Create a [framework] component for [specific functionality] following [design system/style guide]. Include proper TypeScript types, error handling, and accessibility attributes.
