## About Me

I'm a product-minded design leader working at the intersection of product strategy, design systems, and emerging technologies like AI. I specialize in building scalable foundations that help companies move faster, reduce technical debt, and deliver better experiences across complex ecosystems.

As a founding designer in multiple startups, I’ve learned how to tie design decisions directly to business outcomes.

I also teach designers and product teams how to connect research, vision, and execution — turning user insights into prototypes in weeks, not months.

When I’m not working, you’ll find me hiking 🏔️, cycling 🚴‍♀️, or exploring the woods with my dog, Pixel 🦮. I also share what I learn through educational content at thedesignsystem.guide.
