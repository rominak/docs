ðŸ‘‹ I'm Romina. I explore how AI, UX, and design systems intersect. I also coach teams, build scalable solutions, and share insights into whatâ€™s next in design. I love every bit of it. 

I share what I learn through educational content on this website, at [thedesignsystem.guide](https://thedesignsystem.guide) or on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@designsystemguide).
